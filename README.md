## IOT based Air Pollution Monitoring

The purpose of this Air Pollution Monitoring is to monitor the Air quality over a webserver using internet and also trigger the alarm when the air quality goes down in the certain level, means when there are sufficient amount of harmful gases are present in the air like CO2, smoke, alcohol and etc. It will show the air quality in PPM on webpage so that we can easily monitor.

We can monitor the air pollution level from anywhere using our computer or mobile with (internet of course). We can install the system anywhere so that we are always updated.
